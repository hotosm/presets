## HOWTO-XMLLINT (on ubuntu)

XMLLINT will auto indent your xml files.

This is extremely useful for doing multiple line find-replace functions.

First you can find-replace all occurances of tab(\t) with nothing(blank) in the file to unindent it. 

Then you can do multiple line find-replace to add or delete code (`\n` is line return,
`\t` is tab


### INSTALL XMLLINT:

```
$ sudo apt-get install libxml2-utils
```

### Configure XMLLINT
XMLLINT by default uses to spaces(  ) to index instead of tab(\t).

To change this to tab run:

```
$ gedit ~/.bashrc
```

Once in this file add these lines onto the end of the file:

```
# set tab as default for xmllint --format
export XMLLINT_INDENT=$'\t'
```

Save the file

### Run XMLLINT
To run XMLLINT run this command:

```
$ xmllint --format [FILE_NAME] > [NEW_FILE_NAME]
```

To not create a new file run:

```
$ xmllint --format [FILE_NAME] > temp; mv temp [FILE_NAME]
```
